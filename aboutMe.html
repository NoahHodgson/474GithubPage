            <h2>General:</h2>
            <p> 
                Hey what is up? My name is Noah Hodgson and I am
                a (super) Senior here at University of Delaware.
                I have an Associates Degree in the Arts and have 
                8 classes left before I graduate with my BS in Computer
                Science. My concentration is Software Engineering and 
                it is what I hope to pursue professionally.
            </p>

                This summer I had an internship with WL Gore.

                    Here's a link to a funny Seinfeld bit referencing Gore.

                It was a phenomenal experience. I learned so much! I built a physical
                project that involved sensors and the Arduino language. Then using IOT 
                my team took that stream of data, cleaned it, and displayed it on a website that
                I launched myself. The project is still in-development, so I can't say too much more,
                but it was awesome.
