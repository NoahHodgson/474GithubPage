    <h1>About me - Noah Hodgson</h1>
    <h2>General:</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 90%;">
        Hey what is up? My name is Noah Hodgson and I am
        a (super) Senior here at University of Delaware.
        I have an Associates Degree in the Arts and have
        8 classes left before I graduate with my BS in Computer
        Science. My concentration is Software Engineering and
        it is what I hope to pursue professionally.

        It was a phenomenal experience. I learned so much! I built a physical
        project that involved sensors and the Arduino language. Then using IOT
        my team took that stream of data, cleaned it, and displayed it on a website that
        I launched myself. The project is still in-development, so I can't say too much more,
        but it was awesome.
